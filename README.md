## 'Git' it Running

Shoppies was built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), styled with [Tailwind.css](https://tailwindcss.com/), and deployed on [Vercel's edge network](https://vercel.com/). Ready to `git` it running?

1. `git clone` to your working directory
2. `yarn` to install your dependencies
3. Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` and put your [OMDB API key](http://www.omdbapi.com/apikey.aspx) in it
4. `yarn dev` to launch the app!

## Create. Iterate. Repeat.

Great products take iteration. Here are some things I'd like to do Shoppies 2.0:

### Optimize for mobile with React Native

With nearly ‚Öî of orders on Shopify on mobile devices, I want to ensure entrepreneurs can easily make their movie nominations on the go just as they are able to checkout and manage their storefronts from anywhere. Specifically, I want to consider how my user will use the movie app across platforms and how to leverage native components.

### Accessibility

Shopify understands the world is better with more voices. That starts with the tools that we create with accessibility in mind, including this movie nomination app! Improvements may include choosing semantic HTML for screen reader readability, automatic focus, and text alternatives.

## Hi! I'm Alice üëã

Being a transformation driver fuels me as I create lasting, measurable impact with code. Steve Jobs famously asked John Sculley if he wanted to sell sugar water for the rest of his life or change the world with Apple. I'll tell you what, I sure don't want to sell sugar water. Do you?

Thank you for checking out my Shopify frontend intern challenge! üçø
